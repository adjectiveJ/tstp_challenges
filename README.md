Challenges from The Self-Taught Programmer by Cory Althoff

adjectiveJ here! I'm currently working through "The Self-Taught Programmer" by Cory Althoff. I have some experience with Python 2 from my scripting class back in college (2008-2009), as well as a short Python 3 online course I took at San Diego Continuing Education.

I'm hoping to work through this book and gain a better understanding of Python, as well as which direction I would like to go next with my learning.

Some next steps in my journey if I get lost:
 - Work through "Automating the Boring Stuff with Python" (Udemy course or online book)
 - Start using Codewars
 - Read "Clean Code"
 - Learn about data structures and algorithms
 - Learn about leetcode
 - Learn about servers/clients
 - Work on HTTP server projects
 - Learn about tests (unit tests, integration tests, mocks)
 - Create tests for previous projects
 - Learn Docker
 - Work Docker into HTTP projects
