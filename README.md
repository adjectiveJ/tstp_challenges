Challenges from The Self-Taught Programmer by Cory Althoff

2021 June 1
adjectiveJ here! I'm currently working through "The Self-Taught Programmer" by Cory Althoff. This is my motivational statement to myself: I will work through this whole book and finish it before I turn 31 (September 2021)! 

I have some experience with Python 2 from my scripting class back in college (2008-2009), as well as a short Python 3 online course I took at San Diego Continuing Education.

I'm hoping to work through this book and gain a better understanding of Python, as well as which direction I would like to go next with my learning. To help, I've gone looking for some direction and now have the following (which needs to be further fleshed out)...

Some next steps in my journey if I get lost:
 - Work through "Automating the Boring Stuff with Python" (Udemy course or online book)
 - Work through "Learn Python the Hard Way"
 - Start using Codewars
 - Read "Clean Code"
 - Learn about data structures and algorithms (check out MIT free courses)
 - Learn about leetcode
 - Learn about servers/clients
 - Work on HTTP server projects
 - Learn about tests (unit tests, integration tests, mocks)
 - Create tests for previous projects
 - Learn Docker
 - Work Docker into HTTP projects

Good Luck!
